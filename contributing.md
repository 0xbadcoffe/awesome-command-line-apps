# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a 
  duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Titles need to be [capitalized][capitalized] properly. Don't be lazy. For 
  help with this, see [Online Capitalize Tool][Online Capitalize Tool]. Use 
  *Chicago Manual of Style* rules.
- Keep descriptions short and simple.
- Avoid leading descriptions with `A`.
- Avoid using descriptions containing `command-line` â€” it's a CLI list anyway.
- End all descriptions with a full stop/period.
- Order titles alphabetically within each category, Vim style, ignoring leading 
  uppercase.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Pull requests that are not fixed according to the comments within one week 
  will be closed.
- No social media related applications.
- Do not delete any previous entry ever, with the sole exception that a project 
  is officially superseded/continued by the one you're replacing it with.
- Wikipedia pages are not considered to be a valid link source. Find the most
  recent source and link to that instead if there's no project website.
- Node.js command-line tools are accepted very rarely. This is mainly due to the
  extreme overhead of dependencies most Node applications rely on. Also, systems
  level programming in JavaScript is just wrong. Not everything that *can* be
  written in JavaScript *should* be written in JavaScript.

Thank you for your suggestions!
